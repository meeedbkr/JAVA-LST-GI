## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises, tutorials, and practical sessions that cover various Java programming topics, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and software design patterns. The exercises and projects were completed as part of my Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science, and are organized into different folders based on topic.

## Exercises

The exercises are designed to help students practice and reinforce their understanding of different Java programming concepts. Each folder contains a set of exercises related to a specific topic, along with a README file that explains the purpose of the exercises and provides instructions on how to complete them.

## Tutorials

The tutorials provide detailed explanations and examples of Java concepts, making it easy for beginners to understand and follow along. Each tutorial includes code snippets and examples that demonstrate how to use different Java programming features.

## Practical Sessions

The practical sessions include real-world Java projects, such as building a web application, implementing a database system, and creating a graphical user interface. These projects provide students with hands-on experience working with Java programming tools and techniques.
