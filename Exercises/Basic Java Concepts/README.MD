# Basic Java Concepts

This folder contains a set of exercises that cover some of the fundamental concepts of Java programming. The exercises are designed to help students develop a solid understanding of the basic building blocks of Java, including variables, data types, control structures, and methods.

## Exercise 1

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to help students understand how to declare and use variables in Java.

### Instructions
1. Create a new Java file named `Exercise1.java`.
2. Declare two integer variables named `x` and `y`.
3. Assign the values `10` and `5` to `x` and `y`, respectively.
4. Use the `+` operator to add `x` and `y` together, and store the result in a new variable named `sum`.
5. Print the value of `sum`.

## Exercise 2

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to help students understand how to use conditional statements in Java.

### Instructions
1. Create a new Java file named `Exercise2.java`.
2. Declare an integer variable named `x`.
3. Assign a value of your choice to `x`.
4. Use an `if` statement to check if `x` is greater than `10`.
5. If `x` is greater than `10`, print the message "x is greater than 10".
6. If `x` is less than or equal to `10`, print the message "x is less than or equal to 10".

## Exercise 3

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to help students understand how to use loops in Java.

### Instructions
1. Create a new Java file named `Exercise3.java`.
2. Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10 to the console.
